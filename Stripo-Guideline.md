# How To Stripo - Journey Horizon Guideline

Hello JHers, as you know, creating an email template with pure HTML/CSS is a nightmare because we have to fix many bugs on Apple Mail, Outlook Mail, and some old Email clients. Especially when we work with transactional email, it takes a lot of time to implement, push settings, create a transaction and wait for the email to be sent to test. That is the reason why Stripo appears and resolves some of our problems.
